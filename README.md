# FacialExpressionClassification
I was interested in this dataset https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/iapsmessage.html, which is just available to Ph.D. students, and not for Data Science learners in general. Since I can't get access to it, I looked for a small dataset to apply my idea. I am thinking of training a machine to recognize facial expressions, which will help in online learning, in a way that teachers can get an idea of how their students feel during the class(whether they are happy, sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, and Neutral).
